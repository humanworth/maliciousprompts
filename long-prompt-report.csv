**I. Introduction**
   - Brief overview of the concept of input sanitization.
   - Importance of security in digital systems.
   - Thesis statement: Input sanitization is a critical practice to ensure the integrity, security, and functionality of modern systems.

**II. Understanding Input Sanitization**
   - Definition of input sanitization.
   - Common types of inputs that require sanitization (e.g., user data, API requests).
   - Examples of vulnerabilities caused by unsanitized inputs (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

**III. Consequences of Neglecting Input Sanitization**
   - Impact on system security:
     - Unauthorized access.
     - Data breaches.
   - Damage to user trust and company reputation.
   - Financial loss due to exploitation and recovery efforts.

**IV. Best Practices for Input Sanitization**
   - Validating data types, formats, and ranges.
   - Using parameterized queries and prepared statements.
   - Employing libraries and tools designed for secure input handling.
   - Regularly updating and auditing systems for vulnerabilities.

**V. Real-World Examples**
